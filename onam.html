One of the most popular festivals of India, people celebrate it with great zeal. Similarly, activities of this festival are famous all over India for their grand scale and delicious food. We will take a look at the various festivities and celebrations like Onam Pookalam and more.</p>
 <i><b><u><h1>The Story Behind Onam
</h1></u></b></i>
<p>
 The harvest festival of Onam generally begins between August end and the start of September. In other words, during the Malayalam month of Chingam. We celebrate the festival to welcome the mythical King Mahabali.

It is believed that his spirit visits the state in the duration of Onam. The festival originates from the ancient times of Lord Vishnu. One day, he transformed himself into a dwarf Brahmin, Vamana.

In this avatar, he went to attend the Yaagam which King Mahabali was hosting. Thus, Vamana made a request for three feet of land. King Mahabali obliged for the same. However, then the dwarf started to grow bigger in size claiming the Earth and heaven.

As the dwarf covered the whole land, sparing nothing, King Mahabali made an offer of his own head to keep his word. However, he kept a condition that he would be allowed to visit people’s homes every year once. Thus, we celebrate it as King Mahabali’s homecoming.
